I am a postdoctoral scientist with focus on epilepsy research. 
I studied human medicine in Mexico, where I also concluded my PhD. After that, I moved to Germany to continue my research path and here I am. 

I am interested in neuroscience, electrophysiology, data analysis, and preclinical and clinical research.
